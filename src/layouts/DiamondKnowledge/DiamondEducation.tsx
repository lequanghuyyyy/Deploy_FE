                    <p>Each GIA-certified diamond sold at MEEZ has an identifier etched on its girdle. These are like
                        our fingerprints, unique features that distinguish them. The 4Cs standard includes: color,
                        clarity, cut, and carat weight, which is the globally accepted standard for assessing the
                        quality of a diamond.</p>
                    <h2><strong>DIAMOND CUT QUALITY</strong></h2>
                    <h3><strong>1. What is a diamond cut</strong></h3>
                    <p>The quality of the cut is considered the most important factor in the 4C standards. The cut
                        refers to how the facets of the diamond interact with light. It is determined by the symmetry,
                        proportion, and polish. More than any other factor, the cut determines the beauty of the stone.
                        At Meez, from the smallest to the largest stones, all are cut to prioritize brightness over
                        carat weight. Weight does not determine the beauty of the stone.</p>
                    <h3><strong>2. Why is the diamond cut important?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Simply put, the cut determines the sparkle quality of a diamond. If a diamond is poorly cut, it
                        will appear dull even if it has high color and clarity. If a diamond is well-cut, it will
                        reflect and refract light for maximum brightness and sparkle. At Meez, our consultants are
                        rigorously trained with international standards to help customers get the best diamond within
                        their desires.</p>
                    <h3><strong>3. What is a 3EX cut?</strong></h3>
                    <p>This is an excellence criterion for the cut of a diamond, including precision of the cut, polish,
                        and symmetry. All must be at an excellent level to maximize the light reflection capabilities or
                        brightness, resulting in an incomparably sparkling stone. We often refer to this type of cut as
                        three levels of excellence.</p>
                    <p>At Meez, this information about the diamond is always public and transparent to our customers. We
                        uphold the principle of absolute honesty in professional knowledge when consulting to ensure
                        wise choices for our clients.</p>
                    <h3><strong>4. What Affects Diamond Cut Quality?</strong></h3>
                    <p>This is the only factor among the 4Cs that is affected by human hands. Two diamonds may have the
                        same clarity, color, and carat weight, but the cut is what determines if one outshines the
                        other. The three factors determining the cut of a diamond are as follows:</p>
                    <h4><strong>4.1 Precision of the cut</strong></h4>
                    <p>How dimensions and angles relate to different parts of the stone.</p>
                    <h4><strong>4.2 Symmetry</strong></h4>
                    <p>How the different facets of a diamond align and intersect precisely.</p>
                    <h4><strong>4.3 Polish</strong></h4>
                    <p>The details and positioning of the cut shapes as well as the external finish of the diamond.</p>
                    <h3><strong>5. Diamond Cut Chart</strong></h3>
                    <p>There are different cut qualities in the jewelry world like “excellent”, “very good”, “good”,
                        “fair”, and “poor”. At Meez, we always choose the “excellent” cut for diamonds to advise our
                        customers.</p>

                    <h3><strong>6. Types of cuts in diamond crafting</strong></h3>
                    <p>There are three diamond cuts used to manufacture every diamond shape: the brilliant cut, the step
                        cut, and the mixed cut.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Brilliant cut</strong></h4>
                    <p>The brilliant cut is the most common arrangement of facets. Triangular and kite-shaped facets are
                        all arranged to optimize brilliance or light reflection. The round brilliant diamond, with 57 to
                        58 facets, is the most brilliant among diamond cuts. Cushion, oval, marquise, pear, and
                        heart-shaped diamonds are also cut using the brilliant facet style and are similar to the round
                        brilliant in terms of sparkle.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Step cut</strong></h4>
                    <p>The step cut has trapezoidal facets that run parallel to the diamond's girdle, much like a
                        staircase. This facet style emphasizes the color and clarity of the diamond. This cut is most
                        famously used for emerald-shaped diamonds.</p>
                    <h4><strong>Mixed cut</strong></h4>
                    <p>Mixed cuts combine aspects of both brilliant and step cuts.</p>
                    <h2><strong>DIAMOND CLARITY ACCORDING TO THE 4C STANDARD</strong></h2>
                    <h3><strong>1. What is diamond clarity?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Diamond clarity is a measure of the purity and rarity of the gem, classified by the visibility of
                        internal flaws under 10 times magnification. A diamond is classified as flawless if under 10
                        times magnification, no internal flaws and no external blemishes are seen. The experts at MEEZ
                        strictly advise our clients on this criterion. We always want your engagement ring to be in the
                        best possible condition.</p>

                    <h3><strong>3. Is diamond clarity really important?</strong></h3>
                    <p>A diamond with poor clarity often has many inclusions, directly affecting its sparkle. Impurities
                        hinder the refraction and reflection of light, so the lower the clarity, the less brilliant your
                        diamond will be. It's like the sun covered by fog; you won't see the radiant brilliance inherent
                        in the diamond.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <h2><strong>DIAMOND COLOR ACCORDING TO THE 4C STANDARD</strong></h2>
                    <h3><strong style={{fontSize: '20.16px'}}>1. Diamond color</strong></h3>
                    <p>We're talking about the natural color state of white diamonds. In nature, most white diamonds
                        have a hint of yellow. Diamonds closer to the “colorless” state are more precious and rare. The
                        method of distinguishing diamond color worldwide is to evaluate the color of each stone using an
                        overall color scale, using letters from D (colorless) to Z (light brown) to name their
                        colors.</p>
                    <h3><strong style={{fontSize: '20.16px', color: '#333333'}}>2. Diamond color chart</strong></h3>
                    <p>At Meez, we only use engagement diamonds within the “colorless” and “nearly colorless” range on
                        the diamond color scale. Specifically, for engagement rings, Meez uses color D, color E, color
                        F, color G, color H, and color I diamonds. This ensures that your diamond engagement ring always
                        attracts attention due to the magical sparkle of the diamond.</p>

                    <h3><strong style={{fontSize: '20.16px', color: '#333333'}}>3. Is diamond color important?</strong>
                    </h3>
                    <p>Color is the second most important factor in the 4C standards of diamonds because the color level
                        directly affects their appearance. Diamonds with a lower color grade may appear slightly yellow
                        instead of the bright white desired. Also, MEEZ always advises our clients to avoid stones with
                        strong or excessive fluorescence. They can make white diamonds appear cloudy under natural
                        light.</p>
                    <h2><strong>CARAT IN THE 4C STANDARD</strong></h2>
                    <h3><strong>1. What is a diamond carat?</strong></h3>
                    <p>Carat denotes the weight of a diamond, not its size. By international convention, diamonds are
                        measured to 1/1000 of a carat; one carat equals 0.20 grams. To maximize the beauty of a diamond,
                        focus on the quality of its cut, not its weight.</p>
                    <h3><strong>2. Common diamond carat weights</strong></h3>
                    <p>Carat weight can appear different across various diamond shapes like round brilliant, princess,
                        pear, oval, cushion, marquise, emerald, radiant, or heart. A diamond with a higher carat weight
                        does not necessarily mean it's larger, while two diamonds with the same carat weight might
                        differ in size if one is cut deeper than the other. In other words, it's important to note that
                        carat weight does not necessarily indicate size.</p>

                    <h3><strong>4. Is a higher Carat weight better?</strong></h3>
                    <p>In this aspect, carat weight does not determine the value of the diamond. For example, two
                        one-carat stones may differ in price considering clarity, color, and cut. This means the special
                        scarcity of large diamonds of perfect quality.</p>
